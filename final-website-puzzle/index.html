 artists from Renaissance era to the 19th century. The simualtion allows the
 user play with visuals and "enter into artist's mind" so-to speak.
 The movement of the mouse across the image grids feels relaxing and satistyfing, and at the same
 time invites the user to passively participlate in his imagination.
