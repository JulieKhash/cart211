    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 10 - Commodification and Recuperation</h2>
    <p>
      Having a large follower base means having a certain influence on them. But their number grows as the populartiy grows, so there are big responsibilities. People will look up to you and always expect extraordinary action, and whatever you post and write on the Internet will be geared towards bolstering and preserving your e-reputation. I’m saying “e-reputation” because I wonder how much of what we do and publish on the Web is our true self? Thanks to the creative possibilities the Internet grants us today, we can come with the characters and personalities we want, share them and say whatever we want. It seems that the Internet has given humanity freedom of self-expression and action. But then again, is this really freedom? We mostly comply with the virtual norms that were imposed by corporate giants. When the TV came in existence, it was like a magic mirror telling the truth. Everyone would believe whatever it showed and said because it was a revolutionary invention of the media and the issues of manipulation has not yet risen. Then comes the Internet, which has become a platform for self-expression, communication and more. Now it seems that we have passed through the era of television, the Internet at a fundamental level is its modern alternative, with the main difference being that the users can control the content and choose the check the information at their own will. But it’s hard to say that the Internet is completely egalitarian. One gets the impression that there is a constant clash between its total democratization and imperialization. Having said that, I think there’s a huge hope that content creators will be able to make big changes to the Internet and the world. By practicing culture jamming with a network of influencers, we could fight the capitalistic and centralized system, or at least instill fear of democracy in corporations. Influencers, whether their personalities are real or not, need to communicate the right message to their audience unless they are driven by selfish actions to increase their popularity or do anything for the sake of money. Personally, if I was a virtual influencer, I would probably think twice before advertising any commissions. Larger corporations will strategically want to increase their power by selecting celebrities to advertise their brands. But as an influencer, every step taken towards society will reflect on the culture and, ultimately, the kind of world we live in...
