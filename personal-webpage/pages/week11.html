    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 11 - Tech Capitalism</h2>
    <p>
      I think that unlike in the pre-network era, people today are well equipped with media platforms that provide opportunities for self-expression and exchange of thoughts. Undeniably, the Internet has revolutionized our perception of the world.
      In the same way that industrialization transformed the way we work, replacing human labour with machine production, the Internet has played an important role in bringing up numerous hidden social issues to the surface. Of course, it’s not to say
      that all the social, political and economic issues have been resolved; in fact, this put us in a more complex social position, opening our eyes to the endless diversification of the world.
      We often ask, “How much from what I read is truth”, or “How didn’t I know that before?”, etc. Since networking technologies dominate the world, for the most part, they shouldn’t be separated from our profession and life and likely dictate our
      approach to work. Computers take on repetitive tasks, saving a lot of human energy and time, which means they can’t yet be as creative as the human mind. So today’s challenge is more about creative work than painstaking work. In essence, most of
      the work we do digitally isn’t that much different from the material one. The work exists and is real, but over time it has become intangible. And we have no choice but to embrace digital labour and adapt to technology as the current era demands.
      I believe it’s important to support creative people who can’t afford access to digital technology and their training.
      In the past, artisans made a living with their craftsman skills, but this doesn’t mean that handicraft practice should end along with digital technology, but rather they need to “transfer their creative skills” into the digital realm. This is why
      we need to equip all people with enough modern technology to cultivate their creativity because technology gives endless opportunities for creative minds.
