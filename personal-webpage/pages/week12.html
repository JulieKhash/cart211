    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 12 - Crisis</h2>
    <p>
      With the tremendous speed at which the world spins and moves forward, it would be harder for me to imagine an effective school curriculum for 2030. By the time we learn about one innovation, there will be next, the next and so on. The world seems to be changing, but our teaching methods are lagging behind.I can definitely say that after the COVID-19, we can’t go back to the normal “traditional” way of teaching and learning. The Internet and technology have made it possible to teach and learn without taking face-to-face classes. It helped some, while others found it difficult to adapt to a new format. I believe that the education system has to be reformed through more efficient use of technology. As the Internet has become the main destination for information and learning resources, it turns out that we can gain the necessary skills and knowledge through self-study, instead of attending formal educational institutions that may unnecessarily drag lots of people’s time. I believe that every person is unique and has to express themselves in some creative way. So, I would make a pedagogical model that would help each student to open up their individual potential by the use of advanced technologies. I think that the main obstacle for our generation is that students struggle to understand the role, impact, and implementation of digital technology, despite all the theories and facts. Giving them the opportunity to learn new technologies as a new medium of expression is a good place to start. I expect that programming language will be as important as speaking English in today’s world, so coding wouldn’t be that different from writing an essay. I hope this will allow students to discover the potentials of the new medium and gain a deeper understanding of what they might need it for. I also think that true knowledge comes from personal experience and practice. However, theory and discussions are helpful to bring larger issues: socio-cultural, political, economic and envirnomental challenges, into the awareness. But in most cases, the reality can be different from what’s recorded in history and books, and students must be ready for unexpected outcome and learn to think creatively in a given circumstance.
