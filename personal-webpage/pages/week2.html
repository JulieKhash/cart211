    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 2 - Internet History </h2>
    <p>
      Considering the multifaceted history of the Internet, itâ€™s difficult to imagine myself being in the center of the complex events like Cold War, Anti-War protest, academic exploration of Web and computation. All of them had a substantial influence
      on the evolution of the Internet. I agree with Edwards, in the Writing of the History of the Internet when he states that the history of the Internet is rather a collage rather than a linear narrative. I believe that the implementation of any
      revolutionary idea is fraught with great risk in terms of financial resources and impact on the world. Geniuses usually stand behind their innovative ideas, they are full of inspiration and resilience, while the government and bureaucracy get in
      their way, unless it somehow benefits the national goals. I agree that the war had definitely a huge impact on the development of the computer industry. The military agencies were willing to cover the almost entire cost of funds for the computer
      development. For example, Operation Igloo White had cost almost a billion dollar per year between 1967 and 1972. In a military electronic operation, a number of electronic sensors and computers were used to automate the collection of intelligence
      and data transmitted to it. Such a large contract for military projects will undoubtedly allow faster technical advances and achieve research goals. But this creates a huge gab between the democracy and centralized authority. From my perspective,
      both open and closed approaches to the Internet are essential in maintaining a balance between publicity and privacy. When the service is too centralized, it reinforces bureaucratic leadership by limiting the freedom and decision making, while a
      total democracy and transparency may carry its own risks such as creating conflicts and losing privacy.
