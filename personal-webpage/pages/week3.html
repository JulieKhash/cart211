    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 3 - Global Network Issues</h2>
    <p>
      The population of the North Turtle will inevitably depend on tech services of its southern neighbor until a stable network infrastructure established in the country that declares its full technological autonomy. On the other hand, when each
      country has its own separate network, it will lead to national divisions between different countries. If the government asked me to assist with its with its new tele-communication infrastructure, I would first define the goals and priorities. If
      the first objective is set to provide employment in tech industry, I would propose to organize technology education centers, where people can learn about Internet, communication networks, information services and obtain technical skills. It will
      also create a dedicated community of citizens who is going to invest in the development of a new long-term online infrastructure in upcoming future. This encourages an inclusive workplace where all work towards the same social goal â€“ to make
      Internet accessible to anyone. But since many of the tech services are already provided by another country, which is more powerful for the time being, we will still need rely on their assistance while preparing proper technicians and staff. We
      need to take into account that the total technological sovereignty will require a lot of time and huge financial support as well. The other side of the goal is the international relations. How will two countries be connected by having separate
      communication networks? Do we need to work together to develop an applicable protocol for both parties? Or will this new plan create rivalry and ruin the peaceful relations? Of course, these are broader issues, but if the initial goal concerns my
      own nation and people who suffer from the digital gab my task would be to ensure they have access to the Internet and computers. If the southern country is trying to dominate Turtle Island by utilizing its technological power than I would suggest
      creating decentralized Internet and call out for community of individuals, technicians, teachers, and aspired students, who are driven by social, political, and economic situations of their nations.
