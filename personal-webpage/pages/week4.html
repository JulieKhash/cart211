    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 4 - Internet Art</h2>
    <p>
      In my observation, many inventions often boil down to the fact that people need to express themselves in all possible ways. So, they consciously or accidentally build platforms to express their ideas, feelings and personality. Internet Art has
      been one of those innovative tools that have explored the possibility of self-expression and better connection with people around the world. I find it surprising to see how people in the late 90's were obsessed with the idea of personal
      web-building, and that this practice was common and open to everyone. Today, creating a web from scratch seems unthinkable to the general public, and one must believe he or she must finish school to be able to host a personal network. I am
      wondering if popular 21st-century social networks like Facebook, Instagram and many other web-based services have shaped our ideology of the Internet to the point where we, the users, cannot think of anything different than just using ready-made
      templates and strictly posting the pictures? The creativity of the Internet has become limited in a sense. The idea of Geocities struck me as pretty amazing. Although it was short-lived, the incorporation of commonplace web design was the door to
      exploring the early potentials of the Internet and technology.
      Designing a web with code and from scratch implicates building your own personal universe with the ability to teleport to a virtual universe and also, being able to travel into the others. I find the work of Olia Lianlina’s "teleportacia"
      interesting, as she experiments with storytelling in non-linear forms. This reminds me that when we try to recall a particular occasion, we usually remember pieces of the information, fragments of imagination, images and words that are imprinted
      in our minds like snippets of code, but not as it was in reality. I think that the success of an artist can be measured as an impact they make on society or just a single individual. But I prefer to have an opinion about the work of art itself
      than the artist himself. It’s an art that leaves an imprint on people’s minds and hearts, artist is just a title.
