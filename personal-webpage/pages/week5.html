    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 5 - Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      It is always a good idea to start by clarifying the company’s goals to avoid potential missteps and conflicts, especially when the situation has a possible global reach. If I was hired by Omnicopr with the duty of winning the competition over
      another tech company, my goal would be to spend the given budget on recruiting as many high-paid professionals as possible and establishing a working environment that encourages them to research, design and develop many innovative products that
      will bring our company tremendous profits. On the other hand, if the company’s purpose was to be more society-oriented and was in line with the principles of the Free Software movement, I would shift my focus to supporting and funding
      enthusiastic students who are driven by Free Software culture. From my perspective, a culture of a committed community, where the rules and principles are followed in relation to established goals has a stronger ground for creative and beneficent
      success. The Free Software movement is motivated by the generous and unselfish goal of advocating for freedom for users of the software, and that using, copying, studying and modifying software must be free. GNU Project stands ready to support
      this movement in a spirit of community. But, again, everything boils down to finances. It’s true that money is an important resource for encouragement, development, and success in both situations. But what we invest money in is more crucial than
      the profit itself. Spending this budget on the younger generation would be the better decision because of their sense of eagerness zeal and pure intentions to contribute to the world and make it a better place. It’s true that there are many
      complexities involved around Intellectual Property and copyright, especially when ideas and inventions become public domain. But it depends on intentions. Competivitess is focused on profits and gains, while non-profit collaborations are more
      concerned with the common good. I doubt that GNU’s principles can ever comply with the capitalistic system as it boldly attempts to prevent the rat race from polluting people’s minds.
