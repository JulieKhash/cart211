    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 7 - Gender and Ideology in Software</h2>
    <p>
      Deliberate or accidental access to confidential content such as the personal information of employees at work is rather a sophisticated case. Especially, when you are in a weaker position in the company’s hierarchy. Yet, my response to situations such as realizing gender inequality within the company will depend on a number of factors. As a matter of fact, my reaction will largely depend on the gender to which I belong. As a female, if I found out that the company I work for pays less to all the women doing the same amount of work as their male coworkers, I’d definitely get angry and emotional. But at the same time, I’d consider my current power and influence in the company, as well, how my career depends on it. Even though this was a manager’s fault that disclosed the truth about the company, how am I supposed to tell my boss this?  Wouldn’t be I accused of spying on restricted information, even though it is not the case? However, there are a few ways to handle it. One of them is to inform the female colleagues about existing gender inequalities in the company and to take collective action, then individual. We could do this by proving our rights by presenting comprehensive historical records of women who contributed greatly to the emergence of software and computer. Not only that, but going on a deeper understanding of the principles of nature and the universe, and the fact that feminine and masculine principles are inseparable closely related to computer software. The latter is a little far-fetched, but the possibility. It’s true it takes a lot of collective effort, energy, and advocacy, but as long as it objectively proves the point, we are on the right track. There’s another viewpoint on the initial scenario. Slavoj Zizek’s video “They live” explores the notion of ideology and what it is like to live with it. An illusion is like n eyeglass we wear, but the reality is what’s behind it, or it may be otherwise, glasses are given to see the truth. In other words, if there was no cause, in our case the manager disclosing the sensitive data, I probably wouldn’t have known about the existence of sexism in the company. But since this happened my perception of reality would have changed dramatically, and I would have begun to look at my environment differently. On the other hand, being a web designer is the job that I love and, and at first, I was happy to work for this particular company, unless I was aware of the gender imbalance.The questions remain. Am I concerned about my personal career goals and passion? Does this disparity anyhow limit my actions? Or am I more socially oriented and inherently concerned about gender roles?
