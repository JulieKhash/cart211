    <h2>Reading Answer for Week 8 - Hacker Culture</h2>
    <p>
      As is commonly said, knowledge is power but it can also be dangerous. If I had access to the confidential company data, it would certainly clear most of the fog from in my mind.
      The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable and influential businesses in the world. And, unsurprisingly, behind drug manufacturing are convoluted bureaucratic processes such as IP and patent protection, political and economic debate, and fierce competition.But the case becomes especially delicate when it comes to COVID-19. The disease hit a global scale suddenly when almost noone was practically ready for it. It also presented pharmaceutical companies with a new, more challenging task. Because the virus spread quickly and unlike other viruses that humanity has ever witnessed, it required swift action from the government and the pharma corporations. Now the main problem and goal are to save lives and understand the nature of this mysterious virus. If I understood from data on the private server network, to the extent that my professional job allowed, that the company makes a lot of profit from the sale of hygiene products and has the potential to own a vaccine patent to the vaccine, without having a decent medical history, I would probably study the situation more extensively. People are dying due to lack of healthcare and inability to pay for treatment, while medical manufactures compete for the patent, its safety and profit. That’s is a devastating situation. However, I believe that collective effort is always powerful, especially when it comes to knowledge and skills. Just like hackers, like Aaron Swartz, who are outstanding and confident in their field, medical researchers own authority in their fields. Let’s say, businesses depend on high profile professionals, who have all the expertise of how to complete the task that noone else can. In this sense, the scientists and researchers who are responsible for the development of the product can have equal power in decision making and reforming the capitalist system. Yet, money and fame cross the road and divagate into corruption. I think that COVID-19 has brought up the deep-seated defects of the governing and healthcare systems, where, in which racial inequality still exists. But when it comes to the specific question of what I personally do as a web technician, I would estimate my knowledge and ability according to the challenge. Most hackers love extreme challenges and see if they can unlock the closed door, or fight the system because they feel powerful at mastering programming. But I doubt I could fight the corrupt monopoly system individually with a little technical skills and wihout understanding the mechanics of how the authory operates in the the society. Many compulsive and thoughtless actions may lead to a destriction for all.
